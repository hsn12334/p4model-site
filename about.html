  <h1>About the P4 Model</h1>
  <p>Our mission is to bring hope and progress to underserved communities through the P4 strategy. We aim to ensure its core message resonates deeply across every corner of society. The goal is to bridge the divide between the affluent and the underprivileged.
    The government has set a target to identify 15 lakh households, known as 'Bangaru Kutumbams' or golden families, and appoint 1,00,000 mentors by August 15. These mentors called Margadarsis will offer initial support and continued guidance.
    Support must go beyond a one-time donation; it requires consistent engagement. These Margadarsis can be individuals from industries, philanthropists, NRIs, or anyone already aiding the needy. They will be brought onto the P4 platform to serve with compassion and commitment.
    With P4, our shared vision is to eradicate poverty from Andhra Pradesh by 2029. It is an ambitious mission one that demands dedication, but with united will, we believe it's within reach. The top 10% of wealth creators are encouraged to uplift the bottom 20%, nurturing a culture of purposeful giving.
